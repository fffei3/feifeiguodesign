<p>My Passion for <strong>Being Adventurous</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™m always willing to try new things to see what gonna happen. It might fail like I tried to learn skiing from Youtube videos and not really working in practice. It might succeed that I did my first solo trip to the UK and enjoyed all the unexpected beauty of it. The unfamiliar makes me nervous but also makes me stronger. And all these experience are memorable and brings me so much positive impact and inspiration for my life. </p>
<br>
<p>My Passion for <strong>Being empathetic</strong></p>
<p>How do senior people adapt to the new technology and how can we make their life easier? Why there are an increasing number of single people nowadays and why all those dating apps not working? I started to raise more curiosity about different people and what they are experiencing. Many times, I like listening to people talk, observe and feel their feelings, it taught me to respect all the people, all their thinking and experiences.</p>

<p>My Passion for <strong>Doing Good Design</strong></p>
<p class="main">All the passion in my life inspired me to do good design and be a good designer. I love conducting user testings to learn user behavior. I love ideating on creative solutions. I embrace failure, learn from it and keep iterating. I gained enthusiasm, patience, persistence in design, and will keep doing it.
