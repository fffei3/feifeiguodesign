<h6>The prompt</h6>
<p>Help people aware of microaggressions and change their behavior in daily communication</p>
<br>
<h6>Problem</h6>
<p>We all have stereotypes, all the time, without knowing it. These biases come from our various background, cultural environment and personal experience.</p>

We consciously and unconsciously reveal these attitudes and beliefs through different ways in everyday life.
It might hurt a certain person or a group through our implicit actions verbally or nonverbally.

**78%** of people experienced at least 1 microaggression over a two-week period.

<br>
<h6>Solution</h6>
<p><strong>Make the invisible visible.</strong>

Leverage technology to help people notice and rethink their microaggression behavior in real time, educate and inform people to interact better with each other.</p>

<h6>Scenario 1</h6>

![](/images/micro_story1.png)

![](/images/micro_flow1.png){:height="700px" width="700px"}.

<br/>

The aggressor notices the microaggressive behavior immediately
* Quickly save events
* Save for later recall and training
* Track behavior for improvement

![](/images/micro_flow2.png){:height="700px" width="700px"}.

<br/>

The microaggression is recognized and raised by the recipient
* A quick overview of the person talking with, to help determine potential risks or consequences of responding
* Choose preset less attacking language

The aggressor needs to respond to the recipient as soon as possible
* The aggressor's watch got locked until initiate a further conversation
* Confront the problem with each other in a timely manner

<h6>Scenario 2</h6>

![](/images/micro_story2.png)

View daily activities and track a specific microaggression
* A clear overview of the records of their microaggression
* Choose to track particular microaggressions based on their preferences

Interact and engage in the community
* Friends at the same stage of achievement are able to encourage and motivate each other
* Badge awards empower people to be more aware of their behavior

Be educational and bring more engagement
* Read and learn about the impact and how to improve their behavior
* Have a quiz to make sure they gain the knowledge of the particular type of microaggression

Track long-term microaggression stats
* Provide insights on how the user's performance in the past week or month in a visualized way
* Be able to improve their behavior and keep track of them

<h6>My process</h6>

I started with establishing a tangible design process in the early stage to have a clear and specific scope about the necessary phases of thesis project and breakdown to the tasks for each week and each day.

<h6>Findings from interview</h6>

<p>During the time I started to interview different people about their understanding and experience about microaggressions. I realized there are some pain points the they are struggling about.</p>
<ol>
<li>The recipients of microaggressions always feel a sense of powerlessness and invisibility, while the aggressors were often unaware of the harm they've brought.</li>
<li>The recipients of microaggressions are often regarded as oversensitive and take offense too easily.</li>
<li>Because microaggressions are so subtle and ambiguous. it's often hard to know if you're committing one or if you're on the receiving end.</li>
<li>The recipients of microaggressions have a significant negative impact on their mental and physical health.</li>
</ol>

<br/><br/>

<h6>Target audience</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Students and faculty</strong> who experience microaggression in daily communication and have difficulty to pinpoint and respond microaggression within the school community</li>
<li><strong>Office workers</strong> who would like to pay more attention to how they talk in the workplace to improve personal growth and build a more inclusive environment</li>
</ul>

<h6>Visual design</h6>
For both the watch and mobile user interface, I utilize color to indicate different status and level of intensity, for example, the pinkish color represents an aggressive and unstable situation and the light green color expresses a safe and good condition.

<h6>Reflection</h6>
The purpose for this thesis project is to bring more awareness to people while communicating with others in daily life and I explored a new experience to have real-time detection and long-term tracking system to make microaggression less ambiguous and uncertain. Instead, it should be more visible and encouraged to confront and transform into a more positive conversation.
During the time I talked to people with different cultures and races and did some research about microaggression, I found out some typical scenarios that happen a lot among these people and came up with the idea to solve the problem. There are some technical and other issues I didn't take into consideration yet, which I hope I can have better solutions after further testing and deeper learning.
