<h6>Problem</h6>
<p>Over 85% of the 3,000 students said that time management is an issue to them.
There is a lot of flexibility with college life. From doing class assignments, having exams to socializing with friends and having a part-time job, college students don?t want to put much time and effort in planning and thinking about their time in daily life.</p>
<br>
<h6>Solution</h6>
<p>Design a system for college students who feel difficult to organize and balance their time, leveraging their needs and preferences to help them with time management based on a customized plan.</p>
<br>

<p>I did research about some task planning, habit forming products and got some inspirations from them.</p>

<h6>Persona</h6>

<h6>Lo-fi wireframes</h6>
The low fidelity wireframes help me identify the optimal framwork of the app and better understand the user behavior on each screen.

<h6>Design decisions</h6>

</div>

<ol>
<li>The chatbot conversation screen allows users to tell their request via voice or keyboard.</li>
<li>Users say the goals they want to accomplish today and the system can auto-detect the keywords and create tasks for them.</li>
<li>The app will pre-select the tasks that are closer to the due date and prioritize them as urgent tasks.</li>
<li>Tasks are divided into different categories which help users quickly identify which one they would like to complete.</li>
<li>Users are able to see existing schedules which do not need to set up every day and they can easily unselect one if they don't want to continue doing it.</li>
<li>After confirming the goals, the homepage will display all tasks users need to follow on that day and different sizes of chunks show that length of the tasks.</li>
<li>The current task will change to bright color and show the progress.</li>
<li>If the user clicks into a particular task, it shows timer and let him/her focused on the current task.</li>
<li>If the user didn't finish the task on time, (s)he can expand the extra time to get things done.</li>
<li>If the user has urgent things to do, it allows him/her add a new task and input basic information in a quick and easy way.</li>
</ol>

<br/><br/>

<h6>Takeaways</h6>
<p>During the design iterations and getting feedback from classmates, I found out that there is a lot to consider when designing for the voice-based chatbot. </p>
<ul>
<li>The chatbot message sending to users cannot be too long to read at a time, it needs to be short and concise. </li>
<li>The language and tone should be read like an actual human so that people feel reliable while using it. </li>
<li>The chatbot should indicate clearly what the user needs to do next, otherwise, the user might feel confused and get stuck.</li>
<li>Because the main function of the chatbot is to help people set up their daily goals easier, so the challenge is to make sure the tasks displayed in a logical way so that can help them quickly identify the ones they want to accomplish today.</li>
</ul>
